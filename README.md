## Overview
The coronavirus took the entire world by surprise, changing everyone's daily routine. City dwellers no longer spent their free time outside, going to cafes and malls; more people were at home, reading books. That attracted the attention of startups that rushed to develop new apps for book lovers.

You've been given a database of one of the services competing in this market. It contains data on books, publishers, authors, customer ratings and reviews of books. This information will be used to generate a value proposition for a new product.

## Goal
Based on the given data, the goal is to create a product value proposition that articulates the product's purpose, features and differentiators while taking into account the customer's problems, needs and wants. This is to ensure that target prospects will read more about the company and understand what they will get out of the products and services.
